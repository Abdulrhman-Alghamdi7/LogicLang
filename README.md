# LogicLang
A Python-based propositional logic language for defining variables and functions, building expressions with standard operators (~, &amp;, |, ->, &lt;->), and performing semantic evaluation. Supports satisfiability, validity, contradictions, models, countermodels, truth tables, and includes a REPL or script execution.
